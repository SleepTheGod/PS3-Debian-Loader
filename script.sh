echo "Starting the process to format the fourth partition of VFLASH and load Petitboot with a custom Debian kernel."

# Define variables
VFLASH_DEVICE="/dev/sdX" # Change /dev/sdX to the actual VFLASH device. Be VERY careful.
PARTITION_SIZE="40GB" # Set the size of the partition
DEBIAN_KERNEL="/path/to/custom/debian_kernel.img" # Path to your custom Debian kernel image
PETITBOOT_IMAGE="/path/to/petitboot.img" # Path to your Petitboot image

# Step 1: Unmount the VFLASH device to ensure it's not in use
echo "Unmounting $VFLASH_DEVICE..."
umount ${VFLASH_DEVICE}?* 2> /dev/null

# Step 2: Use parted to resize/create the fourth partition. This step is risky and may vary based on your setup.
echo "Resizing/creating the fourth partition on $VFLASH_DEVICE to $PARTITION_SIZE..."
# Warning: The following command is an example and might need to be adjusted for your setup!
parted $VFLASH_DEVICE mkpart primary ext4 100% 100%+$PARTITION_SIZE

# Step 3: Format the newly created/resized partition with ext4 filesystem
echo "Formatting the fourth partition with ext4 filesystem..."
mkfs.ext4 ${VFLASH_DEVICE}4

# Step 4: Copy the custom Debian kernel to the formatted partition
echo "Copying the custom Debian kernel to the formatted partition..."
dd if=$DEBIAN_KERNEL of=${VFLASH_DEVICE}4 bs=1M

# Step 5: Handle Petitboot loading. This part is significantly simplified and needs to be adjusted to your specific method.
echo "Copying Petitboot image to an appropriate location (this step is highly dependent on your setup)..."
# Example: Copying Petitboot to a USB drive or another recognized location
cp $PETITBOOT_IMAGE /path/to/target/location

echo "Process completed. Please ensure to review and adjust each step according to your specific setup and requirements."

# Reminder: PS3 Slim compatibility with USB in Petitboot is noted as an issue. Ensure to incorporate any necessary workarounds for your setup.
